                           ------=== Brew your CoffeeScript in the JetBrains IDE ===------



## Features

CoffeeBrew is a plugin for your [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com) IDE to develop your CoffeeScript.

* Syntax highlighting with a color settings preference pane
* Commenting and uncommenting of line and block comments
* Highlighting of matching braces

## Installation

The plugin can be installed via the JetBrains plugin manager from within your IDE.

## CoffeeBrew RubyMine theme

![CoffeeBrew RubyMine theme](https://github.com/netzpirat/coffee-brew/raw/master/resources/theme/CoffeeBrew.png)

The [CoffeeBrew RubyMine theme](
https://github.com/netzpirat/coffee-brew/raw/master/resources/theme/CoffeeBrew.xml) provides a dark color scheme that
extends the fabulous [RailsCast](http://blog.bitfluent.com/post/198076049/railscasts-theme-for-rubymine) theme with fine
grained CoffeeScript colors. The font on the screenshot is [Meslo LG S DZ](https://github.com/andreberg/Meslo-Font).

To install the CoffeeBrew color scheme in RubyMine 3.0.1 on Max OS X, just download CoffeeBrew.xml to
`~/Library/Preferences/RubyMine30/colors`, restart the IDE and select the new color scheme in your preferences.
For other platforms the folder within the Preferences directory is different, e.g. RubyMine31, IntelliJIdea10CE or
IntelliJIdea9, to just name a few.

## Development

* Source hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/netzpirat/coffee-brew).
